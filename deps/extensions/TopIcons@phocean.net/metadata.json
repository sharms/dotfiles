It is a fork from the original extension from ag  with settings for icon opacity, saturation, padding, size and tray position, along with a few minor fixes and integration with the Skype integration extension.\n\n** In case of issue, please install the github version. Then, you may open a case there. The problem is that fixes can take a long time before being available here (validation process). **",
